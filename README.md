Line-Describe
A java programm with gui interface to input 2 lines and tell if they're coincident parallels, different parallels, competing straight lines or straight lines

I.E:

Input 1 = x = 2 + 3t; y = 4 + 2t; z = 1 + 4t
Input 2 = x = 4 + t ; y = 2 + 3t; z = 1 + 5t

Output: two vectors and "RETAS REVERSAS"
